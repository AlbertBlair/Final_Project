# Final_Project
This is my Capstone Project for CODE:KY's Web Development course.

## Project Details

This project is a "Who's That Pokemon" quiz. The quiz can be found on the Quiz page. I also included an home page and a contact page. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JS. I utilize PokeAPI to retrieve data for the Quiz, and no API Key is needed. Media Queries, Flexbox, and CSS GRID are used to adjust the website for different screen sizes.

The Quiz pulls pokemon for Generation 1 - 5. Once the user gets 3 answers wrong, an alert will pop up. If the user chooses to play again the quiz will reset from the beginning. As the user gets more answers right the background will change symbolizing higher tier levels, but this also resets if the user chooses to play again.


## Features
1. Use arrays, objects, sets or maps to store and retrieve information that is displayed in your app.
    - store pokemon IDs and Names in to arrays.

3. Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.
    - Function to check users answer in the Quiz

4. Retrieve data from a third-party API and use it to display something within your app.
