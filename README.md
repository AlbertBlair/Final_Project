# Final_Project


Project Details

This project is a "Who's That Pokemon" quiz. The quiz can be found on the Quiz page. I also included an home page and a contact page.This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JS. I utilize the PokeAPI to retrieve data for the Quiz. Media Queries, Flexbox, and CSS GRID, are used to adjust the website for different screen sizes.

The Quiz pulls pokemon for Generation 1 - 5. Once the user gets 3 answers wrong, an alert will pop up. If the user chooses to play again the quiz will reset from the beginning. As the user gets more answers right the background will change symbolizing higher tier levels, but this also resets if the user chooses to play again.
